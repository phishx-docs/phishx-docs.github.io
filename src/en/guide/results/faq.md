Main questions and their answers.

## How do I access detailed results?

   You can consult data online directly on our dashboards on the platform, export reports in various formats or integrate our data via API.

## What actions are recommended by default for my campaign?

   We recommend a main action for your knowledge trail, such as training, questionnaire, policy, etc., and an interaction action, such as feedback or NPS.

   All models can be customized and adapted to your planning.

## Which and how many people clicked on any link in the message (they fell into the simulation)?

   The people who reached the first action according to the campaign, after interacting (clicking) on a link in the message.

   In campaigns that have training in the first action, the result will be **data.1** or **data.training**.

## Which and how many people did the training completely?

   The people who finished the first action according to the campaign, and were referred to the second action.

   In campaigns that have two or more actions, with training being the first action and closing in the second action, the result will be **data.2** or **data.closure**.

## Who and how many people ended all actions in a campaign?

   The people who finished all the actions according to the campaign, and were sent to the configured page (by default the company's website).

   In campaigns that do not have a final formal action, such as redirecting to another page, the result will be **data.last**.
