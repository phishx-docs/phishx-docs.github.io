# Campaign approvals

::: tip Additional approvals
Before an official campaign is sent, we recommend setting up a formal approval process.<br>
This process can be internal to your company, or optionally integrated into the PhishX platform.
:::

Manage the settings for the campaign approval module.

1. In **Settings** -> **Campaign approvals**.

   In **Enabled** define whether the module will be enabled.

   Optionally in **Owner** define whether the author of the campaign can be part of the approval.

   Optionally in **Notification** define whether members of the approval team will receive notification e-mail.

   In **Teams** define which approval teams will be enabled.

   ::: tip Multiple teams and approvers
   Your company can have multiple teams of users and approvers.<br>
   Each team of users can be associated with a different team of approvers.
