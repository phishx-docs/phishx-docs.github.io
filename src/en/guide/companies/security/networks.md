# Networks

::: tip Be careful when configuring trusted networks
If you configure any network, our firewall will block other public accesses according to the enabled module.<br>
Check with your team which networks are reliable and whether you really need to enable them in our protection.<br>
If you need additional support, talk to [Customer Success](mailto:cs@phishx.io).
:::

Manage access protection through networks (**Firewall**).

1. In **Settings** -> **Networks**.

   Add a new. Click **+**.

   Insert **network** in **CIDR** format. (Ex: **10.0.0.0/8**)

   Insert a **description**.

2. Optionally configure the protections for the **My PhishX Networks** and **API Networks** modules.
